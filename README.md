# dunsany

*text encoding and analysis of various works of Lord Dunsany*

Work is just beginning and I’m starting by gathering the short stories in three collections recommended by John D. Rateliff.

- `raw-pg/` contains the raw Project Gutenberg texts of the three collections listed below (one file per volume)
- `raw-text/` contains the raw texts of each short story in a separate file
- `scripts/` contains Python scripts for generating the raw text and XML
- `xml/` contains generated XML versions of each short story
- `docs/` contains generated HTML versions of each short story for display via Github Pages

Next up is another round of improvements to the XML markup.

After that, preparation for linguistic analysis will be done.
