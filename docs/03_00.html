  <h1>Preface</h1>
  <p>
    Ebrington Barracks
  </p>
  <p>
    Aug. 16th 1916.
  </p>
  <p>
    I do not know where I may be when this preface is read. As I write it
    in August 1916, I am at Ebrington Barracks, Londonderry, recovering
    from a slight wound. But it does not greatly matter where I am; my
    dreams are here before you amongst the following pages; and writing in
    a day when life is cheap, dreams seem to me all the dearer, the only
    things that survive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just now the civilization of Europe seems almost to have ceased, and
    nothing seems to grow in her torn fields but death, yet this is only
    for a while and dreams will come back again and bloom as of old, all
    the more radiantly for this terrible ploughing, as the flowers will
    bloom again where the trenches are and the primroses shelter in
    shell-holes for many seasons, when weeping Liberty has come home to
    Flanders.
  </p>
  <p>
    To some of you in America this may seem an unnecessary and wasteful
    quarrel, as other people’s quarrels often are; but it comes to this
    that though we are all killed there will be songs again, but if we
    were to submit and so survive there could be neither songs nor dreams,
    nor any joyous free things any more.
  </p>
  <p>
    And do not regret the lives that are wasted amongst us, or the work
    that the dead would have done, for war is no accident that man’s care
    could have averted, but is as natural, though not as regular, as the
    tides; as well regret the things that the tide has washed away, which
    destroys and cleanses and crumbles, and spares the minutest shells.
  </p>
  <p>
    And now I will write nothing further about our war, but offer you
    these books of dreams from Europe as one throws things of value, if
    only to oneself, at the last moment out of a burning house.
  </p>

    DUNSANY.
