  <h1>EPILOGUE</h1>
  <p>
    Here the fourteenth Episode of the Book of Wonder endeth and here the
    relating of the Chronicles of Little Adventures at the Edge of the
    World. I take farewell of my readers. But it may be we shall even meet
    again, for it is still to be told how the gnomes robbed the fairies,
    and of the vengeance that the fairies took, and how even the gods
    themselves were troubled thereby in their sleep; and how the King of
    Ool insulted the troubadours, thinking himself safe among his scores
    of archers and hundreds of halberdiers, and how the troubadours stole
    to his towers by night, and under his battlements by the light of the
    moon made that king ridiculous for ever in song. But for this I must
    first return to the Edge of the World. Behold, the caravans start.
