  <head>THE WONDERFUL WINDOW</head>
  <p n="1">
    The old man in the Oriental-looking robe was being moved on by the
    police, and it was this that attracted to him and the parcel under his
    arm the attention of Mr. Sladden, whose livelihood was earned in the
    emporium of Messrs. Mergin and Chater, that is to say in their
    establishment.
  </p>
  <p n="2">
    Mr. Sladden had the reputation of being the silliest young man in
    Business; a touch of romance—a mere suggestion of it—would send his
    eyes gazing away as though the walls of the emporium were of gossamer
    and London itself a myth, instead of attending to customers.
  </p>
  <p n="3">
    Merely the fact that the dirty piece of paper that wrapped the old
    man’s parcel was covered with Arabic writing was enough to give Mr.
    Sladden the idea of romance, and he followed until the little crowd
    fell off and the stranger stopped by the kerb and unwrapped his parcel
    and prepared to sell the thing that was inside it. It was a little
    window in old wood with small panes set in lead; it was not much more
    than a foot in breadth and was under two feet long. Mr. Sladden had
    never before seen a window sold in the street, so he asked the price
    of it.
  </p>
  <p n="4">
    <q>Its price is all you possess,</q> said the old man.
  </p>
  <p n="5">
    <q>Where did you get it?</q> said Mr. Sladden, for it was a strange window.
  </p>
  <p n="6">
    <q>I gave all that I possessed for it in the streets of Baghdad.</q>
  </p>
  <p n="7">
    <q>Did you possess much?</q> said Mr. Sladden.
  </p>
  <p n="8">
    <q>I had all that I wanted,</q> he said, <q>except this window.</q>
  </p>
  <p n="9">
    <q>It must be a good window,</q> said the young man.
  </p>
  <p n="10">
    <q>It is a magical window,</q> said the old one.
  </p>
  <p n="11">
    <q>I have only ten shillings on me, but I have fifteen-and-six at home.</q>
  </p>
  <p n="12">
    The old man thought for a while.
  </p>
  <p n="13">
    <q>Then twenty-five-and-sixpence is the price of the window,</q> he said.
  </p>
  <p n="14">
    It was only when the bargain was completed and the ten shillings paid
    and the strange old man was coming for his fifteen-and-six and to fit
    the magical window into his only room that it occurred to Mr.
    Sladden’s mind that he did not want a window. And then they were at
    the door of the house in which he rented a room, and it seemed too
    late to explain.
  </p>
  <p n="15">
    The stranger demanded privacy when he fitted up the window, so Mr.
    Sladden remained outside the door at the top of a little flight of
    creaky stairs. He heard no sound of hammering.
  </p>
  <p n="16">
    And presently the strange old man came out with his faded yellow robe
    and his great beard, and his eyes on far-off places. <q>It is finished,</q>
    he said, and he and the young man parted. And whether he remained a
    spot of colour and an anachronism in London, or whether he ever came
    again to Baghdad, and what dark hands kept on the circulation of his
    twenty-five-and-six, Mr. Sladden never knew.
  </p>
  <p n="17">
    Mr. Sladden entered the bare-boarded room in which he slept and spent
    all his indoor hours between closing-time and the hour at which
    Messrs. Mergin and Chater commenced. To the Penates of so dingy a room
    his neat frock-coat must have been a continual wonder. Mr. Sladden
    took it off and folded it carefully; and there was the old man’s
    window rather high up in the wall. There had been no window in that
    wall hitherto, nor any ornament at all but a small cupboard, so when
    Mr. Sladden had put his frock-coat safely away he glanced through his
    new window. It was where his cupboard had been in which he kept his
    tea-things: they were all standing on the table now. When Mr. Sladden
    glanced through his new window it was late in a summer’s evening; the
    butterflies some while ago would have closed their wings, though the
    bat would scarcely yet be drifting abroad—but this was in London: the
    shops were shut and street-lamps not yet lighted.
  </p>
  <p n="18">
    Mr. Sladden rubbed his eyes, then rubbed the window, and still he saw
    a sky of blazing blue, and far, far down beneath him, so that no sound
    came up from it or smoke of chimneys, a mediaeval city set with
    towers; brown roofs and cobbled streets, and then white walls and
    buttresses, and beyond them bright green fields and tiny streams. On
    the towers archers lolled, and along the walls were pikemen, and now
    and then a wagon went down some old-world street and lumbered through
    the gateway and out to the country, and now and then a wagon drew up
    to the city from the mist that was rolling with evening over the
    fields. Sometimes folks put their heads out of lattice windows,
    sometimes some idle troubadour seemed to sing, and nobody hurried or
    troubled about anything. Airy and dizzy though the distance was, for
    Mr. Sladden seemed higher above the city than any cathedral gargoyle,
    yet one clear detail he obtained as a clue: the banners floating from
    every tower over the idle archers had little golden dragons all over a
    pure white field.
  </p>
  <p n="19">
    He heard motor-buses roar by his other window, he heard the newsboys
    howling.
  </p>
  <p n="20">
    Mr. Sladden grew dreamier than ever after that on the premises, in the
    establishment of Messrs. Mergin and Chater. But in one matter he was
    wise and wakeful: he made continuous and careful inquiries about the
    golden dragons on a white flag, and talked to no one of his wonderful
    window. He came to know the flags of every king in Europe, he even
    dabbled in history, he made inquiries at shops that understood
    heraldry, but nowhere could he learn any trace of little dragons <hi>or</hi>
    on a field <hi>argent</hi>. And when it seemed that for him alone those
    golden dragons had fluttered he came to love them as an exile in some
    desert might love the lilies of his home or as a sick man might love
    swallows when he cannot easily live to another spring.
  </p>
  <p n="21">
    As soon as Messrs. Mergin and Chater closed, Mr. Sladden used to go
    back to his dingy room and gaze though the wonderful window until it
    grew dark in the city and the guard would go with a lantern round the
    ramparts and the night came up like velvet, full of strange stars.
    Another clue he tried to obtain one night by jotting down the shapes
    of the constellations, but this led him no further, for they were
    unlike any that shone upon either hemisphere.
  </p>
  <p n="22">
    Each day as soon as he woke he went first to the wonderful window, and
    there was the city, diminutive in the distance, all shining in the
    morning, and the golden dragons dancing in the sun, and the archers
    stretching themselves or swinging their arms on the tops of the windy
    towers. The window would not open, so that he never heard the songs
    that the troubadours sang down there beneath the gilded balconies; he
    did not even hear the belfries’ chimes, though he saw the jack-daws
    routed every hour from their homes. And the first thing that he always
    did was to cast his eye round all the little towers that rose up from
    the ramparts to see that the little golden dragons were flying there
    on their flags. And when he saw them flaunting themselves on white
    folds from every tower against the marvelous deep blue of the sky he
    dressed contentedly, and, taking one last look, went off to his work
    with a glory in his mind. It would have been difficult for the
    customers of Messrs. Mergin and Chater to guess the precise ambition
    of Mr. Sladden as he walked before them in his neat frock-coat: it was
    that he might be a man-at-arms or an archer in order to fight for the
    little golden dragons that flew on a white flag for an unknown king in
    an inaccessible city. At first Mr. Sladden used to walk round and
    round the mean street that he lived in, but he gained no clue from
    that; and soon he noticed that quite different winds blew below his
    wonderful window from those that blew on the other side of the house.
  </p>
  <p n="23">
    In August the evenings began to grow shorter: this was the very remark
    that the other employees made to him at the emporium, so that he
    almost feared that they suspected his secret, and he had much less
    time for the wonderful window, for lights were few down there and they
    blinked out early.
  </p>
  <p n="24">
    One morning late in August, just before he went to Business, Mr.
    Sladden saw a company of pikemen running down the cobbled road towards
    the gateway of the mediaeval city—Golden Dragon City he used to call
    it alone in his own mind, but he never spoke of it to anyone. The next
    thing that he noticed was that the archers were handling round bundles
    of arrows in addition to the quivers which they wore. Heads were
    thrust out of windows more than usual, a woman ran out and called some
    children indoors, a knight rode down the street, and then more pikemen
    appeared along the walls, and all the jack-daws were in the air. In
    the street no troubadour sang. Mr. Sladden took one look along the
    towers to see that the flags were flying, and all the golden dragons
    were streaming in the wind. Then he had to go to Business. He took a
    bus back that evening and ran upstairs. Nothing seemed to be happening
    in Golden Dragon City except a crowd in the cobbled street that led
    down to the gateway; the archers seemed to be reclining as usual
    lazily in their towers, and then a white flag went down with all its
    golden dragons; he did not see at first that all the archers were
    dead. The crowd was pouring towards him, towards the precipitous wall
    from which he looked; men with a white flag covered with golden
    dragons were moving backwards slowly, men with another flag were
    pressing them, a flag on which there was one huge red bear. Another
    banner went down upon a tower. Then he saw it all: the golden dragons
    were being beaten—his little golden dragons. The men of the bear were
    coming under the window; what ever he threw from that height would
    fall with terrific force: fire-irons, coal, his clock, whatever he
    had—he would fight for his little golden dragons yet. A flame broke
    out from one of the towers and licked the feet of a reclining archer;
    he did not stir. And now the alien standard was out of sight directly
    underneath. Mr. Sladden broke the panes of the wonderful window and
    wrenched away with a poker the lead that held them. Just as the glass
    broke he saw a banner covered with golden dragons fluttering still,
    and then as he drew back to hurl the poker there came to him the scent
    of mysterious spices, and there was nothing there, not even the
    daylight, for behind the fragments of the wonderful window was nothing
    but that small cupboard in which he kept his tea-things.
  </p>
  <p n="25">
    And though Mr. Sladden is older now and knows more of the world, and
    even has a Business of his own, he has never been able to buy such
    another window, and has not ever since, either from books or men,
    heard any rumour at all of Golden Dragon City.
